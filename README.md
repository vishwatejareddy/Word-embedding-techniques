# Word-embedding-techniques
This project contains the different word embedding techniques applied on Amazon food reviews Dataset.
## Dataset
Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset is used. The dataset contains 568,454 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012.
## Preprocessing
* Data Cleaning - Deduplications
* Removing html tags , punctuations and set of special characters like , or . or # etc .
* Checking if the word is made up of english letters and not alpha numeric characters .
* Converting to lowercase .
* Removal of stopwords .
* Stemming of words .
## Models
* Bag of Words (BoW)
* Bi-Grams and N-Grams
* TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)
* Average Word2Vec
* TF-IDF weighted Word2vec
* Word2Vec is the most popular technique to learn word embeddings . Embeddings are the vector representation of words and it is capable of capturing context of a word in a   document , semantic and syntatic similarity , relation with other words , etc .
